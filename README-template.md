## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- To use and style the "button" feature with PSEUDO CLASSES in css.
- Cursor apprearance tricks.
- To manipulate @media Query for a RESPONSIVE DESIGN.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
  <button class="btn">
    <img src="./images/icon-cart.svg" alt="cartImg">
    Add to Cart
  </button>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  @media only screen and (max-width: 550px)...
}
```

### Continued development

To master the @media Query for more advance responsive designs and other applications.
